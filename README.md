# Fully-Connected Networks

Implementation of fully-connected networks using a modular approach. For each layer we will implement a forward and a backward function. The forward function will receive inputs, weights, and other parameters and will return both an output and a cache object storing data needed for the backward pass. After implementing a bunch of layers this way, we will be able to easily combine them to build classifiers with different architectures. In addition to implementing fully-connected networks of arbitrary depth, we will also explore different update rules for optimization.
